# siskel
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). 

Siskel is a simple movie rating app. We'll be using this app to explore backbone events and how they relate to MVC components. In particular, you will explore the following ideas:</br>
Controllers translate click events into intention (invoking a model function) </br>
Models effect state changes in other models (by broadcasting events)</br>
Views update as a result of model changes (by listening for changes)</br>
